# Jackson's Doomsday Project

This project implements [Conway's Doomsday Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule)
in various programming languages. It's related to my [court days](https://github.com/jluckyiv/court-days)
project, which calculates which days of the year are California court holidays.
